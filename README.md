## Abstract

Price prediction of properties is one of the most important applications in real estate as the housing market goes through a lot of up-and-downs due to volatile economic cycles. A lot of real estate companies depend on the housing market for their bread and butter such as Real Estate Investment Trust. Such businesses also invest in the apartments and houses in New York state and try to regulate their internal pricing models. In New York City, the housing market including the property prices is quite buoyant due to a lot of macroeconomic reasons. However, it is pertinent to note that the inherent characteristics of the house also is a contributing factor to its pricing. Hence, for purchasers and house investors, having knowledge about the driving factors that influence the pricing of a house in United States is quite helpful in making wise purchasing decisions. The aim of this project is to predict the house listingâ€™s prices in the United States, specifically the state of New York City as that is where housing prices are most volatile. We will use particular features of the nearby neighborhoods and perform regression analysis. After which, we will optimize our model with techniques such as model tuning, feature selection etc. The dataset that we have chosen is from the NYC department of finance which contains information about the sale of properties in New York City over a period of 12 months. The dataset contains about 167720 property sales information pieces. In our dataset, amongst most attributes we will have the Block, neighborhood, borough, Lot, Address, Apartment Number, Zip code. We will then try to implement supervised learning techniques.


## Problem Statement

We will perform regression analysis, lasso regression, random forest regression and ridge regression and optimize our chosen model to the best accuracy
with feature selection, model tuning and other techniques. Meanwhile, the resulting model will create
potential benefits in multiple areas beyond basic price prediction, such as:
1) providing data-proven insights for individual house buyers and sellers;
2) enhancing a balanced leverages between the buyers and sellers;
3) understanding the housing market in general for economists, policy makers or interested
stakeholders/ decision makers.

## Dataset:

The dataset we are using is sales of appartments located in  5 different counties in newyork city.
