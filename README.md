## Abstract

Price prediction of properties is one of the most important applications in real estate as the housing market goes through a lot of up-and-downs due to volatile economic cycles. A lot of real estate companies depend on the housing market for their bread and butter such as Real Estate Investment Trust. Such businesses also invest in the apartments and houses in New York state and try to regulate their internal pricing models. In New York City, the housing market including the property prices is quite buoyant due to a lot of macroeconomic reasons. However, it is pertinent to note that the inherent characteristics of the house also is a contributing factor to its pricing. Hence, for purchasers and house investors, having knowledge about the driving factors that influence the pricing of a house in United States is quite helpful in making wise purchasing decisions. The aim of this project is to predict the house listingâ€™s prices in the United States, specifically the state of New York City as that is where housing prices are most volatile. We will use particular features of the nearby neighborhoods and perform regression analysis. After which, we will optimize our model with techniques such as model tuning, feature selection etc. The dataset that we have chosen is from the NYC department of finance which contains information about the sale of properties in New York City over a period of 12 months. The dataset contains about 167720 property sales information pieces. In our dataset, amongst most attributes we will have the Block, neighborhood, borough, Lot, Address, Apartment Number, Zip code. We will then try to implement supervised learning techniques amongst which the machine learning algorithms that we plan to use are linear regression, lasso regression, random forest regression and ridge regression after cleaning the dataset. In conclusion, there will be multiple benefits of the resultant model in areas in addition to price prediction such as 
a.	Individual House sellers and buyers will have data-proven insights at their fingertips
b.	This project will ensure that there is a balanced and equivalent leverage between the property purchasers and sellers. 
c.	A better understanding of the housing market in New York City for different stakeholders involved such as the policy makers, economists and decision makers.
