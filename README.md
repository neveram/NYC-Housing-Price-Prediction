## Abstract

Due to economic cycles, the housing market in New York City has been in ups and downs for several decades. While economic factors have played a role in the cost of NYC homes, the intrinsic attributes of a home may also play a role in the pricing of a home. It would be useful to examine what the driving factors of a costly property in the United States are in order for house investors and purchasers to make sensible purchasing decisions. Our group's goal in this project is to estimate the values of house listings in the United States based on selected parameters of nearby communities. We'll run regression analysis and use feature selection, model tweaking, and other strategies to improve the accuracy of our chosen model. Data for this project comes from the Finance Department of NYC. 

## Dataset:

The dataset we are using is sales of appartments located in  5 different counties in newyork city.
